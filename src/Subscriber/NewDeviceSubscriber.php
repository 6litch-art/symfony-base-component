/**
 * Reacts to an account being signed into from a browser it has not been
 * signed into before: tells the user by email (administrator's switch), and
 * on an account with no second factor, flags the session so the next page
 * offers - once, optionally - to set up a one-time code
 * (SecurityEnrolmentSubscriber, UserSettingsController::Enrolment).
 *
 * "Browser" here means what UserTracker already means by it: a Connection,
 * keyed by the long-lived id it keeps in a cookie. A sign-in that has to
 * create one is a sign-in from somewhere new. The account's very first
 * sign-in creates one too, and there is nothing useful to warn about then -
 * the person is holding the device in their hand - so the mail goes out only
 * once a second browser appears.
 *
 * Nothing here blocks the login. This is a notice after the fact, not a
 * challenge; the administrator's switch decides whether it is sent at all.
