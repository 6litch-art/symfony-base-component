/**
 * The one service that turns a score into an actual capability.
 *
 * Everything up to here computes and grants nothing: Group::isOpenTo() says
 * whether somebody qualifies and Group::awardsFor() says what they would get,
 * both without touching them. Something has to close the gap, and in
 * fr.latoucheoriginale.www that something is a single service -
 * MarketplaceManager - which evaluates every candidate's scopes and rules,
 * then applies what its actions return. This is the same thing for people.
 *
 * The evaluation loop is deliberately the same shape as getPromotion()'s,
 * including its short-circuits, with one difference that matters: a promotion
 * stops at the first candidate that fits, because a product gets one
 * promotion. A person can qualify for several groups at once, so nothing
 * breaks out of the candidate loop here.
 *
 * Permission tags are resolved to rows here rather than in the adapter, which
 * is the whole reason GrantPermissionAdapter returns strings: an entity that
 * queries is an entity you cannot evaluate offline, so the lookup belongs in
 * the only layer that already has a repository.
